						Ok, I did see a few hands. This short clip from the movie Meet the Parents with Ben Stiller illustrates how it feels to be treated poorly by customer service or support.

						<p>It’s usually not that difficult to keep our customers happy. I have a little story from one of my first jobs that illustrates this.</p>
					
						<p>Back in around <strong>the year 2000</strong>, I worked as a <strong>service technician</strong>, repairing <strong>photocopiers and printers</strong> in large office spaces. At that time, it was common for <strong>50 people in an open-plan office</strong> to share a single printer or copier. And if that machine stopped working, <strong>they couldn’t do their jobs properly</strong>.</p>
					
						<p>So, I would arrive at the office, and <strong>the manager—already quite nervous—</strong> would tell me that his team couldn’t print or copy, and that it was <strong>absolutely critical</strong> to get the machine running again. Then came my favorite question: <em>“What do you think? How long will it take to fix the machine?”</em></p>
					
						<p>As someone with experience, my response was always: <em>“Well, it looks complicated… I’d say maybe <strong>two hours</strong>, or if things go well, maybe just <strong>90 minutes</strong>.”</em>  
						This, of course, knowing that the machine would most likely be up and running in just <strong>30 minutes</strong>.</p>
					
						<p>The manager’s response: <em>“Oh yes, that would be great. Thank you so much!”</em>  
						<strong>He was already satisfied</strong> because he had received a <strong>clear and concrete answer</strong>.</p>
					
						<p>Then, when I actually finished after <strong>45 minutes</strong>, he was even happier and even <strong>gave me a 20-franc tip</strong>. On top of that, he could <strong>take credit for organizing everything so efficiently</strong>.  
						A <strong>classic win-win situation</strong>!</p>

							<p><strong>20/60/20 Model:</strong> The 20/60/20 distribution is a simplified model often used in customer value analysis to categorize groups based on their customer lifetime value (CLV). It is similar to the <strong>Pareto Principle (80/20 rule)</strong>, which states that a small portion of customers (often 20%) bring the most value to a company.</p>
					
							<p><strong>"Let's take a look at this chart. Where would you say your most valuable customers are?"</strong></p>
							
							<p>(Let the audience respond – most will probably point to the middle.)</p>
					
							<p>
							"Exactly! Most customers fall into the middle category—'<strong>active, profitable customers</strong>'—which makes up <strong>60%</strong>. But look at the other two groups:  
							- <strong>Left (orange, 20%):</strong> These customers are low-profit. Why? They lack engagement or only make one-time purchases.  
							- <strong>Middle (red, 60%):</strong> This is where most customers are. They’re good, but not ideal.  
							- <strong>Right (blue, 20%):</strong> This is where we want to be—<strong>highly profitable, loyal customers</strong>."</p>

					<h2>How to Maximize Value from Customer Support?</h2>
					<div class="support-list">

						<p>📌 <strong>Understand Your Customers</strong></p>
						<p>📌 <strong>Proactive Communication</strong> </p>
						<p>📌 <strong>Speed & Accessibility</strong></p>
						<p>📌 <strong>Personalization & Empathy</strong> </p>
						<p>📌 <strong>Continuous Improvement</strong></p>
					</div>

				
					<aside class="notes">
						<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> “Now that we understand why support is crucial, the next question is: <strong>How can we extract the most value from it?</strong> Here are five key strategies.”</p>
				
						<p><strong>1. Understand Your Customers:</strong>  
						- “Without understanding customer pain points, we can't deliver great support.”  
						- “Regular surveys, customer feedback, and analyzing support tickets help identify patterns.”</p>
				
						<p><strong>2. Proactive Communication:</strong>  
						- “Why wait for customers to complain? We should anticipate and resolve issues before they escalate.”  
						- “Example: Automated status updates for support tickets or FAQs that answer common questions in advance.”</p>
				
						<p><strong>3. Speed & Accessibility:</strong>  
						- “Fast support is great support. Long wait times lead to frustration.”  
						- “A multichannel approach: Not every customer wants to call—offer email, chatbots, and help desks.”</p>
				
						<p><strong>4. Personalization & Empathy:</strong>  
						- “No one wants to feel like just another ticket number. Personalized responses build customer loyalty.”  
						- “Support agents should use the customer’s name and avoid copy-paste responses.”</p>
				
						<p><strong>5. Continuous Improvement:</strong>  
						- “Support is a process that must constantly evolve.”  
						- “Support ticket data, recurring issues, and customer feedback should be used to refine products and processes over time.”</p>
				
						<p><strong>Call-to-Action:</strong> “These five strategies aren’t just theory—they are tested and turn customer support into a real competitive advantage!”</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						
						<p><strong>1. First Response Time (FRT):</strong>  
						- "Customers expect quick responses. A long response time increases frustration and churn."  
						- "The faster we respond, the higher the percived service quality."</p>
				
						<p><strong>2. Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):</strong>  
						- "Direct feedback from customers about their support experience."  
						- "Simple post-interaction surveys help us track satisfaction trends."</p>
				
						<p><strong>3. Retention Rate:</strong>  
						- "Great support strengthens loyalty."  
						- "Do customers stay after a support case, or do they leave? Tracking retention tells us how well we are doing."</p>
				
						<p><strong>4. Customer Effort Score (CES):</strong>  
						- "How much effort did the customer need to put in to solve their issue?"  
						- "The lower the effort, the better the experience—and the higher the chance of future engagement."</p>

					<h2>🎯 Well-Trained Support Teams</h2>

					<p class="training-intro"><strong>"A great support team makes all the difference—investing in training pays off."</strong></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> “One of the most overlooked but critical aspects of great customer support is training. No matter how advanced our tools are, a well-trained team makes all the difference.”</p>
					
						<p><strong>Why does training matter?</strong>  
						- "Support teams are the direct connection to customers—how they handle interactions defines the company’s reputation."  
						- "Untrained or poorly trained staff lead to inconsistent experiences, frustration, and even lost customers."</p>
					
						<p><strong>Experience matters—why we shouldn’t put interns or juniors on the front line:</strong>  
						- "The first support interaction can define whether a customer stays or leaves. It’s not the place for trial and error."  
						- "Experienced support agents can quickly identify problems, provide solutions, and de-escalate situations—skills that come with practice."  
						- "Junior staff can and should learn, but their role should be in the background first, gaining experience before taking on direct customer interactions."  
						- "Customers expect expertise. If they feel they’re talking to someone inexperienced, they lose confidence in the company."  
						- "A well-trained senior support team is an investment in customer satisfaction and loyalty."</p>
					
						<p><strong>Call-to-Action:</strong> “If we want support to be a strategic asset, we must prioritize experience and training—because great customer service is not an entry-level job.”</p>
