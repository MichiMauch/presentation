						<p>Ok, I did see a few hands. </p>
						<p>I want to talk in <strong>my session about the importance of good customer service</strong>. This can be directly in support when a customer has a problem, but it can also be when I, as a Digital Consultant, discuss a new project or improvements to their website with them. Essentially, it applies to any situation where I interact directly with a customer.</p>
						<p>First, I want to start with a bad example.

							<strong>This short clip from the movie Meet the Parents</strong> with Ben Stiller, illustrates how it feels to be treated poorly by customer service or support. In the scene, the customer service person is doing her job correctly, just as she was trained. But let’s take a quick look.</p>
							
							<p>This is <strong>how it feels when we make things more difficult</strong> for our customers than they would like.</p></aside>

						And I'm sure that, if possible, I would never want to fly with this airline again. Even though the situation only involved a one-minute wait. <br>But no, I'd rather find someone else.
						<br><br>There is nothing more difficult than regaining a customer's trust once something has gone wrong. <br><br>But we also have to be honest. Our customers pay us 150, 200, or even more francs per hour.
						They deserve nothing less than first-class support—especially after a project that has cost thousands of francs.</aside>

						<p>I remember my time as an trainee. Back then, I had a boss who was very customer-oriented. He <strong>did everything for the customer</strong>—or rather, for the customer's satisfaction. He often said, half-joking but also seriously: "On request, we’ll blow powdered sugar up the customer’s ass."</p>
						<p>To this day, 35 years later, <strong>I still remember that one sentence</strong>. I don’t remember my boss’s name anymore, but that phrase stuck with me. In German, it’s also beautifully simple: "Auf Wunsch wird dem Kunden Puderzucker in den Arsch geblasen."</p>
						<p>Of course, I don’t think we need to be submissive. <strong>We want to meet our customers at eye level</strong>—that makes the work much more relaxed. But still, there is some truth in that sentence.</p></aside>

				<section data-transition="convex" data-background="./assets/winwin.webp" data-background-size="cover" data-background-position="center">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>It’s usually not that difficult to keep our <strong>customers happy</strong>. I have a little story from one of my first jobs that illustrates this perfectly.</p>
						
							<p>Around the year 2000, I worked as a <strong>service technician</strong>, repairing photocopiers and printers in large office buildings. At that time, it was common for <strong>50 people in an open-plan office</strong> to share a single printer or copier. And if that machine stopped working, they couldn’t do their jobs properly. <strong>Back then, the printer was the most important tool</strong> in any office.</p>
						
							<p>So, I would arrive at the office, and the manager—already quite nervous—would explain to me that his team couldn’t print or copy and that it was <strong>absolutely crucial</strong> to get the machine running again as quickly as possible. And then, almost every time, came my favorite question: <strong>"What do you think? How long will the repair take?"</strong></p>
						
							<p>I would then take a close look at the machine, make a few thoughtful "mmhh... puhh... mmhhh" sounds, and say: <strong>"Well, this looks pretty complicated... I’d say maybe two hours. If things go well, maybe just 90 minutes."</strong> Based on my experience, I was usually quite sure that I would actually need only <strong>half that time</strong>.</p>
						
							<p>And the manager’s reaction was almost always the same, in every office: <strong>"Oh yes, that would be great. Thank you so much!"</strong> </p>
						
							<p>When I actually finished after just <strong>45 minutes</strong>, you can’t imagine how happy the manager was. So happy, in fact, that he even gave me a <strong>20-franc tip</strong>. But it was a classic <strong>win-win situation</strong>—he also got a few pats on the back for organizing everything so quickly and getting the machine back up and running!</p>
							<p>Often, all it takes is an answer to make a customer satisfied. <strong>The problem doesn’t always</strong> have to be solved immediately.</p>

					<img src="./assets/emotion_curve.png" alt="Customer Emotion Curve">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p><strong>Let me take you through this emotional journey</strong> – the Customer Emotion Curve – based on my printer repair story.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Problem identified:</strong> Imagine this – the office manager is already stressed. The printer isn’t working, and the entire office is on hold. <strong>Frustration is high</strong>—this is the lowest point on our curve.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Technician arrives:</strong> I walk in. A technician is here! There’s a small sense of <strong>relief</strong>, but uncertenty (uncertainty) remains. <em>Can it be fixed? How long will it take?</em></p>
						
						<p><strong>Uncertain wait:</strong> As I inspect the machine, the manager is still in limbo. The waiting feels endless. <strong>What if this takes all day?</strong> What if it’s expensive?</p>
						
						<p><strong>Estimate given:</strong> Then I provide my assessment: <em>‘This looks complicated… maybe two hours, if we’re lucky, just 90 minutes.’</em> Finally, a <strong>clear answer</strong>! The manager now has a timeframe, and that alone <strong>reduces stress.</strong></p>
						
						<p><strong>Repair faster than expected:</strong> And now comes the best part – I finish in just <strong>45 minutes!</strong> A <strong>positive surprise</strong>. Expectations were low, and now they’re exceeded. The emotional curve <strong>shoots up!</strong></p>
						
						<p><strong>Printer works again:</strong> The moment of <strong>pure relief</strong>. The manager isn’t just satisfied—he’s <strong>thrilled</strong>. So much so that he even gives me a <strong>20-franc tip</strong>!</p>
						
						<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This curve perfectly illustrates <strong>why great customer service matters</strong>. Often, all it takes is <strong>reducing uncertanty (uncertainty) and setting the right expectations.</strong></p>
						<p>This is how it should be in our daily business. But let's turn the story around and see how the situation unfortunately often is.</p>

						<p><strong>Now, let me tell you the same story – but this time, how it should NOT happen.</strong></p>
						
						<p><strong>Problem identified:</strong> The manager is stressed. The printer isn’t working, and the entire office is on hold. <strong>Frustration is at its peak</strong>—we start at the bottom of the curve.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Technician arrives:</strong> I finally show up. There’s a small sense of relief, but I don’t make a especially competent impression. <em>I don’t say anything concrete, just mumble something to myself.</em></p>
						
						<p><strong>Uncertain wait:</strong> The manager asks, ‘How long will it take?’ I shrug. <em>‘Hmm, hard to say… could take a while…’</em>Immidliatly (Immediately), his mood drops again – he has no idea what to expect.</p>
						
						<p><strong>No clear estimate:</strong> Time passes. A lot of time. The manager starts wondering: <strong>Why is this taking so long?</strong> Nobody keeps him informed. <strong>Frustration builds up.</strong></p>
						
						<p><strong>Repair takes longer than expected:</strong> Finally, after what feels like forever, I say, ‘Hmm… this is going to take some more time.’ But still, <strong>no clear answer, no concrete plan.</strong> The manager is now really annoyed.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Printer works again – but frustration remains:</strong> Event-schuely (Eventually), the printer is running again. But instead of relief, the manager just feels frustrated. <strong>‘That took way too long!’</strong> And of course, there’s no tip—just an annoyed säi (sigh).</p>
						
						<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This negative curve shows <strong>what happens when we leave our customers in the dark, fail to set expectations, and make them wait without communication.</strong> This is exactly what we should avoid!</p>

					<h2>How to Maximize Value from Customer Support?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p><strong>Now that we understand why support is crucial</strong>, the next question is: <strong>How can we extract the most value from it?</strong> Here are five key strategies.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="convex">
					<h2>Strategies</h2>
					<div class="support-list">

						<p>📌 <strong>Understand Your Customers</strong></p>
						<p>📌 <strong>Proactive Communication</strong> </p>
						<p>📌 <strong>Speed & Accessibility</strong></p>
						<p>📌 <strong>Personalization & Empathy</strong> </p>
						<p>📌 <strong>Continuous Improvement</strong></p>
					</div>

				
					<aside class="notes">
				
						<p><strong>1. Understand Your Customers:</strong>  
						<ul><li>“Without understanding customer pain points, we can't deliver great support.” </li> 
						<li>“Regular surveys, customer feedback, and analyzing support tickets help identify patterns.”</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>2. Proactive Communication:</strong>  
							<ul><li>“Why wait for customers to complain? We should anticipate and resolve issues before they escalate.”</li>  
						<li>“Example: Automated status updates for support tickets or FAQs that answer common questions in advance.”</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>3. Speed & Accessibility:</strong>  
							<ul><li>“Fast support is great support. Long wait times lead to frustration.”  
						<li>“A multichannel approach: Not every customer wants to call—offer email, chatbots, and help desks.”</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>4. Personalization & Empathy:</strong>  
							<ul><li>“No one wants to feel like just another ticket number. Personalized responses build customer loyalty.”</li>  
						<li>“Support agents should use the customer’s name and avoid copy-paste responses.”</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>5. Continuous Improvement:</strong>  
							<ul><li>“Support is a process that must constantly evolve.”  </li>
						<li>“Support ticket data, recurring issues, and customer feedback should be used to refine products and processes over time.”</li><ul></ul></p>
				
						<p>“These five strategies aren’t just theory—they are tested and turn customer support into a real competitive advantage!”</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="convex">
					<h2>🛠 Tools & Processes:</h2>
				
					<div class="support-tools">
						<p>✅ <strong>AI-powered support</strong> for fast responses</p>
						<p>✅ <strong>Self-service portals</strong> for recurring questions</p>
						<p>✅ <strong>Clear and easy-to-understand guides</strong></p>
						<p>✅ <strong>Well-trained support teams</strong></p>
					</div>
				
					<aside class="notes">
						
				
						<p><strong>How do we achieve this?</strong>  
							<ul>
						<li><strong>AI-powered support:</strong> "Fast responses, automated help, and intelligent suggestions make support more efficient."  </li>
						<li><strong>Self-service portals:</strong> "Let customers find answers on their own for common questions."  </li>
						<li><strong>Clear and easy-to-understand guides:</strong> "No one likes confusing manuals. Keep instructions simple and actionable."</li>  
						<li><strong>Well-trained support teams:</strong> "A great support team makes all the difference—investing in training pays off."</li></p>
					</ul>
						<p><strong>“If we follow this Golden Rule and make things easier for customers, they will reward us with loyalty.”</strong></p>

					<h2>Measuring Support Success</h2>
				
					<aside class="notes">

						<p>“Support success is not just about ‘<strong>feeling good</strong>’—we need to measure it.</p><p>Which metrics show that our support truly delivers value?</p> <p>Here are four key metrics that tell us if our support is truly effective.”</p>
				
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="convex">
					<h2>📊 Metrics:</h2>
					<div class="support-metrics">
						<p>✅ <strong>First Response Time (FRT)</strong></p>
						<p>✅ <strong>Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)</strong> </p>
						<p>✅ <strong>Retention Rate</strong></p>
						<p>✅ <strong>Customer Effort Score (CES)</strong></p>
					</div>
				
					<aside class="notes">
						
						<p><strong>1. First Response Time (FRT):</strong>  
						<ul><li>"Customers expect quick responses. A long response time increases frustration and churn."</li>
						<li>"The faster we respond, the higher the percived service quality."</li></ul>  
						</p>
				
						<p><strong>2. Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):</strong>  
						<ul><li>"Direct feedback from customers about their support experience."  </li>
						<li>"Simple post-interaction surveys help us track satisfaction trends."</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>3. Retention Rate:</strong>  
							<ul><li>"Great support strengthens loyalty."  </li>
						<li>"Do customers stay after a support case, or do they leave? Tracking retention tells us how well we are doing."</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>4. Customer Effort Score (CES):</strong>  
							<ul><li>"How much effort did the customer need to put in to solve their issue?" </li> 
						<li>"The lower the effort, the better the experience—and the higher the chance of future engagement."</li></ul></p>
				
						<p>“If we improve these four key metrics, our support transforms from a cost center into a real value driver for our company.”</p>

					<h2>🎯 Well-Trained Support Teams</h2>

					
					<img src="./assets/bad1.png" width="400pxs" alt="Bad Support">

					<aside class="notes">
						<p><strong>"A great support team makes all the difference—investing in training pays off."</strong></p>
						<p>One of the most overlooked but critical aspects of great customer <strong>support is training</strong>. No matter how advanced our tools are, a well-trained team makes all the difference.</p>
					
						<p><strong>Why does training matter?</strong>  
						<ul><li>"<strong>Support teams are the direct connection</strong> to customers—how they handle interactions defines the company’s reputation."</li>  
						<li><strong>"Untrained or poorly trained staff</strong> lead to inconsistent experiences, frustration, and even lost customers."</li></ul></p>
										
						<p>“If we want support to be a strategic asset, we must prioritize experience and training—because great customer service is not an entry-level job.”</p>
					</aside>
					
				</section>
				<section data-transition="convex">
					<h2>🚫 No Interns on the Front Line!</h2>
					<img src="./assets/junior.png" width="400pxs" alt="Bad Support">

				
				
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>"First impressions matter—customers expect expertise, not training sessions."</p>

						<p><strong>“Support is not an entry-level job. Customers expect professional help, not someone who's still learning the ropes.”</strong></p> 
						<p><strong>Experience matters—why we shouldn’t put interns or juniors on the front line:</strong></p><p> 
							<ul> 
							<li>The <strong>first support interaction</strong> can define whether a customer stays or leaves. It’s not the place for trial and error. </li> 
							<li>Experienced support agents <strong>can quickly identify problems</strong>, provide solutions, and de-escalate situations—skills that come with practice.  </li>
							<li>Junior staff <strong>can and should learn</strong>, but their role should be in the background first, gaining experience before taking on direct customer interactions.  </li>
							<li><strong>Customers expect expertise</strong>. If they feel they’re talking to someone inexperienced, they lose confidence in the company. </li>

					<h2>🎯 Key Takeaways:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Support is not an afterthought</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Great customer service builds loyalty</strong></li>

					</ul>
				
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Alright, let’s quickly go through the most important takeaways.</p>
				
						<p><strong>Support is not an afterthought</strong> – We need to stop seeing support as just a necessary evil. It’s a critical part of our success.</p>
				
						<p><strong>Great customer service builds loyalty</strong> – Customers might forget what you did, but they will always remember how you made them feel.</p>
				
						<p><strong>Uncertainty is the enemy</strong> – The biggest frustration comes from not knowing what’s happening. Setting clear expectations is often more valuable than solving the issue instantly.</p>
				
						<p><strong>Bad support experiences spread fast</strong> – People talk more about bad service than good service. A single bad experience can ruin trust forever.</p>
				
						<p><strong>Well-trained teams are essential</strong> – Support is not an entry-level job. Experienced teams make a huge difference in how problems are solved and how customers feel about our company.</p>
				
						<p><strong>Speed & accessibility are key</strong> – Quick responses and multiple ways to get support create a great customer experience.</p>
				
						<p><strong>Customer support can be a profit driver</strong> – Happy customers stay, recommend us, and are even willing to pay more for good service.</p>
