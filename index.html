						Ok, I did see a few hands. This short clip from the movie Meet the Parents with Ben Stiller illustrates how it feels to be treated poorly by customer service or support. In the scene, the customer service representative is doing her job correctly, just as she was trained. But let’s take a quick look.</aside>

						<p>I remember my time as an trainee. Back then, I had a boss who was very customer-oriented. He <strong>did everything for the customer</strong>—or rather, for the customer's satisfaction. He often said, half-joking but also seriously: "On request, we’ll blow powdered sugar up the customer’s ass."</p>
						<p>To this day, 35 years later, <strong>I still remember that one sentence</strong>. I don’t remember my boss’s name anymore, but that phrase stuck with me. In German, it’s also beautifully simple: "Auf Wunsch wird dem Kunden Puderzucker in den Arsch geblasen."</p>
						<p>Of course, I don’t think we need to be submissive. <strong>We want to meet our customers at eye level</strong>—that makes the work much more relaxed. But still, there is some truth in that sentence.</p></aside>

							<p>It’s usually not that difficult to keep our <strong>customers happy</strong>. I have a little story from one of my first jobs that illustrates this perfectly.</p>
						
							<p>Around the year 2000, I worked as a <strong>service technician</strong>, repairing photocopiers and printers in large office buildings. At that time, it was common for <strong>50 people in an open-plan office</strong> to share a single printer or copier. And if that machine stopped working, they couldn’t do their jobs properly. <strong>Back then, the printer was the most important tool</strong> in any office.</p>
						
							<p>So, I would arrive at the office, and the manager—already quite nervous—would explain to me that his team couldn’t print or copy and that it was <strong>absolutely crucial</strong> to get the machine running again as quickly as possible. And then, almost every time, came my favorite question: <strong>"What do you think? How long will the repair take?"</strong></p>
						
							<p>I would then take a close look at the machine, make a few thoughtful "mmhh... puhh... mmhhh" sounds, and say: <strong>"Well, this looks pretty complicated... I’d say maybe two hours. If things go well, maybe just 90 minutes."</strong> Based on my experience, I was usually quite sure that I would actually need only <strong>half that time</strong>.</p>
						
							<p>And the manager’s reaction was almost always the same, in every office: <strong>"Oh yes, that would be great. Thank you so much!"</strong> He was already satisfied—just because he had received a clear and concrete answer.</p>
						
							<p>When I actually finished after just <strong>45 minutes</strong>, you can’t imagine how happy the manager was. So happy, in fact, that he even gave me a <strong>20-franc tip</strong>. But it was a classic <strong>win-win situation</strong>—he also got a few pats on the back for organizing everything so quickly and getting the machine back up and running!</p>
							<p>Often, all it takes is an answer to make a customer satisfied. <strong>The problem doesn’t always</strong> have to be solved immediately.</p>

							<p><strong>20/60/20 Model:</strong> The 20/60/20 distribution is a simplified model often used in customer value analysis to categorize groups based on their customer lifetime value (CLV). It is similar to the <strong>Pareto Principle (80/20 rule)</strong>, which states that a small portion of customers (often 20%) bring the most value to a company.</p>
					
							<p><strong>"Let's take a look at this chart. Where would you say your most customers are?"</strong></p>
							
							<p>(Let the audience respond – most will probably point to the middle.)</p>
					
							<p>
							"Exactly! Most customers fall into the middle category—'<strong>active, profitable customers</strong>'—which makes up <strong>60%</strong>. But look at the other two groups:  
							<ul><li><strong>Left (red, 20%):</strong> These customers are low-profit. Why? They lack engagement or only make one-time purchases.  </li>
							<li><strong>Middle (green, 60%):</strong> This is where most customers are. They’re good, but not ideal.  </li>
							<li><strong>Right (yellow, 20%):</strong> This is where we want to be—<strong>highly profitable, loyal customers</strong>."</li></ul></p>

					<h2>How to Maximize Value from Customer Support?</h2>

						<p>📌 <strong>Understand Your Customers</strong></p>

						<p>📌 <strong>Personalization & Empathy</strong> </p>
						<p>📌 <strong>Continuous Improvement</strong></p>
					</div>

				
					<aside class="notes">
						<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> “Now that we understand why support is crucial, the next question is: <strong>How can we extract the most value from it?</strong> Here are five key strategies.”</p>
				
						<p><strong>1. Understand Your Customers:</strong>  
						<ul><li>“Without understanding customer pain points, we can't deliver great support.” </li> 
						<li>“Regular surveys, customer feedback, and analyzing support tickets help identify patterns.”</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>2. Proactive Communication:</strong>  
							<ul><li>“Why wait for customers to complain? We should anticipate and resolve issues before they escalate.”</li>  
						<li>“Example: Automated status updates for support tickets or FAQs that answer common questions in advance.”</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>3. Speed & Accessibility:</strong>  
							<ul><li>“Fast support is great support. Long wait times lead to frustration.”  
						<li>“A multichannel approach: Not every customer wants to call—offer email, chatbots, and help desks.”</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>4. Personalization & Empathy:</strong>  
							<ul><li>“No one wants to feel like just another ticket number. Personalized responses build customer loyalty.”</li>  
						<li>“Support agents should use the customer’s name and avoid copy-paste responses.”</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>5. Continuous Improvement:</strong>  
							<ul><li>“Support is a process that must constantly evolve.”  </li>
						<li>“Support ticket data, recurring issues, and customer feedback should be used to refine products and processes over time.”</li><ul></ul></p>
				
						<p>“These five strategies aren’t just theory—they are tested and turn customer support into a real competitive advantage!”</p>

						<p>“Support success is not just about ‘<strong>feeling good</strong>’—we need to measure it.</p> <p>Here are four key metrics that tell us if our support is truly effective.”</p>
				
					</aside>

				<section data-transition="convex">
					<h2>📊 Metrics:</h2>
					<div class="support-metrics">
						<p>✅ <strong>First Response Time (FRT)</strong></p>
						<p>✅ <strong>Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)</strong> </p>
						<p>✅ <strong>Retention Rate</strong></p>
						<p>✅ <strong>Customer Effort Score (CES)</strong></p>
					</div>
				
					<aside class="notes">
						
						<p><strong>1. First Response Time (FRT):</strong>  
						<ul><li>"Customers expect quick responses. A long response time increases frustration and churn."</li>
						<li>"The faster we respond, the higher the percived service quality."</li></ul>  
						</p>
				
						<p><strong>2. Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):</strong>  
						<ul><li>"Direct feedback from customers about their support experience."  </li>
						<li>"Simple post-interaction surveys help us track satisfaction trends."</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>3. Retention Rate:</strong>  
							<ul><li>"Great support strengthens loyalty."  </li>
						<li>"Do customers stay after a support case, or do they leave? Tracking retention tells us how well we are doing."</li></ul></p>
				
						<p><strong>4. Customer Effort Score (CES):</strong>  
							<ul><li>"How much effort did the customer need to put in to solve their issue?" </li> 
						<li>"The lower the effort, the better the experience—and the higher the chance of future engagement."</li></ul></p>

						<p><strong>Experience matters—why we shouldn’t put interns or juniors on the front line:</strong></p><p> 
							<ul> 
							<li>The <strong>first support interaction</strong> can define whether a customer stays or leaves. It’s not the place for trial and error. </li> 
							<li>Experienced support agents <strong>can quickly identify problems</strong>, provide solutions, and de-escalate situations—skills that come with practice.  </li>
							<li>Junior staff <strong>can and should learn</strong>, but their role should be in the background first, gaining experience before taking on direct customer interactions.  </li>
